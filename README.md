# Football REST API

Football REST API is a sample API that allows you manage your football teams.

## What's in it?

- 'Vertical Slices' code structure.
	- This is a personal preference, layered or clean architecture is also fine but I find vertical slices make projects easier to reason.
- Result monad which has a few benefits:
	- Errors as values.
	- Ensures error handling and gets rid of having to try/catch on errors that should not be exceptional to begin with (e.g. validation). Exceptions should be exceptional, i.e. generated by Network, IO, or god forbid actual bugs!
	- Sprinkles a bit of functional goodness on our code.
- Unit tests
- LiteDB for persistence
	- Great for small projects where an embedded DB can get the job done. Visit https://github.com/litedb-org/LiteDB to learn more.
- CQRS from scratch
	- You really don't need Mediatr. Remove indirection and magic while improving performance with basic DI instead.
